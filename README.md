# HololensAssets

Assets for the Hololens Research Project.

settings.txt describes the url of the images located in the subfolder.

Unity will be periodically checking this file.

settings.txt currently needs to be updated with additional links (or have them removed) when the corresponding image is moved. That's just because Unity doesn't parse Github as an actual directory but as an HTML mess instead...so the C# script can't crawl the subfolders itself. (Would be possible with a private hosted server, meaning no settings.txt needed at all).

To add an image, add an image to the image subfolder and add the corresponding raw URL of that image to the settings.txt, under the corresponding name (names start with #). To delete an image, remove the url from settings.txt (technically doesn't even need to be actually removed from github). Changes will be reflected while the program runs, meaning images should cycle (or whatever you are doing with them) in realtime.
