# HololensAssets

Assets for the Hololens Research Project.

settings.txt describes the url of the images located in the subfolder. 

Unity will be periodically checking this file.

settings.txt currently needs to be updated with additional links (or have them removed) when the corresponding image is moved. That's just because Unity doesn't parse Github as an actual directory...so the C# script can't crawl the subfolders itself. (May be possible with a private hosted server, meaning no settings.txt needed at all)
